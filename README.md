# Roll-a-Ball (Unity Learn Tutorial-Based Project)

This repository contains a Unity 3D project created by following the official [Roll-a-Ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) from Unity Learn (version 6.0).

## 🎮 About the Project

This project was built step-by-step by following the tutorial instructions.  
All code was written manually by me during the learning process, although the structure and logic closely follow the tutorial.  
Variable names and formatting may differ slightly, but the overall functionality remains faithful to the original.

No additional features or customizations have been added beyond what is covered in the tutorial.
